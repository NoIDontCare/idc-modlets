## [Advanced Dew Collector](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCAdvancedDewCollector)
An improved version of the vanilla dew collector. Full information available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3150)

## [Animal Snare](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCAnimalSnare)
Requires IDC Core: https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3341/

Taking the functionality from my advanced dew collector mod, I have made an animal snare that functions in a similar way. The snare will produce raw meat, animal fat, or leather every 6 to 8.5 in-game hours provided bait is in the bait slot. It will pick one item randomly and pull from the quantities below. More information available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3343)

## [Beehive](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCBeehive)
Requires IDC Core. https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3341

- Adds beehives that produce honey.  

- Requires a honey bee to be placed inside the Bee slot in order to function. Honey bees have a limited lifespan. They can be found naturally inside new lootable tree stumps that spawn in the pine forest biome.

## [Expanded Writable Storage](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCExpandedWritableStorageCrate)
Adds writable storages with 120 slots. ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH DARKNESS FALLS. WILL NOT WORK WITH VANILLA.

## [Horde Options](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCHordeOptions)
Requires: [CustomGameOptions by w00kien00kie](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/29565-customgameoptions-mod-for-modders-including-source-code/) to function.  
- Screamer Options
	- Allows for an additional gamestage value to be added to the zombies that a screamer will spawn.  
- Wandering hordes
	- Allow for an additional random gamestage value to be chosen between the min and max values set to add to the calculated gamestage for the wandering horde.  
	
For example, if a party has a combined gamestage of 100, and the option 50 is selected, screamers will spawn zombies using the gamestage group 150.  

This mod only affects the zombies spawned by screamers and wandering hordes. Sleepers, horde nights, etc., are unaffected. Does NOT permanently modify your gamestage.  

## Hydroponics
Requires IDC Core: https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3341?tab=description  
  
Adds craftable hydroponics players that allow the player to grow crops in a compact manner.  
  
**Water**  
- Hydroponics basins will consume water from directly below them in order to grow crops. Each "block" of water provides 1000 water to the basin. Plants will consume this water as they grow.  
  
**Battery**  
- Hydroponics basins require a battery to be placed into the battery slot. The quality of the battery does not matter. The battery charge will slowly be consumed as crops are produced.  
  
**Seeds**  
- Hydroponics basins require a seed be placed in the seed slot in order to function. This seed is not consumed and is therefore infinite. Only one seed can be used in a basin at a time.  
- Current supported crops:  
﻿- Potato, corn, super corn, blueberry, goldenrod, chrysanthemum, cotton, aloe, hops, mushroom, and grass.  
- Additional crops (such as those from mods), can be added by editing the mod's xml files.  
  
**Fertilizer**
- Fertilizer is a craftable resource that will increase the yield from the hydroponics basins. Fertilizer is not required for functionality. By default, fertilizer will double the output from the basin.  
  
**Grow Lights**  
- Grow lights will decrease the time it takes for the basins to produce output.

## [More Item Bundles For Darkness Falls](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCMoreItemBundlesDF)
Adds bundles for the following items:
- oil, paper, electrical parts, mechanical parts, animal fat, raw meat, boiled water, forged iron, forged steel, bones, cloth, leather, rotten flesh, brass, cement, concrete mix, cobblestones, iron and titanium darts.

## [No Vehicle Explosions](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCNoVehicleExplosions)
Prevents vehicles from exploding when at 0% health. Must be on both server and client(s). Requires EAC off.

## [No Vending Machine Restock](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCNoVendingMachineRestock)
Vending machines inside POIs restocking daily is boring. Nobody is running around stocking these machines in an apocalypse. This mod fixes that by preventing all vending machines not in trader compounds from restocking. Vending machines inside trader compounds will still restock daily.  
  
Mod can be installed server side only.  
  
NOTE: This mod does modify vanilla trader POIs and will conflict with any mod that also modifies these POIs.

## [No Zombie Crouching](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCNoZombieCrouching)
Stops zombies from crouching in spaces where they aren't able to stand. Does not effect spider zombies or crawlers. Requires EAC off and MUST be installed on both server and client(s).

## [No Zombie Stumble Forwards](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCNoZombieStumble)
In A21, a change was made so zombies have a chance to stumble towards the player when hit in the arm. This would often allow zombies to get free hits on the player with no counter. This mod removes that.  
  
Requires EAC off and MUST be installed on server and client(s). No a server side version only is not possible. Don't ask.

## [Reduced Vehicle Damage](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCReducedVehicleDamage)
Reduces collision damage taken by vehicles by 75%. Requires EAC off and must be on server and client(s).
