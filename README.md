## [Advanced Dew Collector](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCAdvancedDewCollector)
An improved version of the vanilla dew collector. Full information available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3150)

## [Animal Snare](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCAnimalSnare)
Requires IDC Core: https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3341/

Taking the functionality from my advanced dew collector mod, I have made an animal snare that functions in a similar way. The snare will produce raw meat, animal fat, or leather every 6 to 8.5 in-game hours provided bait is in the bait slot. It will pick one item randomly and pull from the quantities below. More information available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3343)

## [Beehive](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/NoIDontCare/idc-modlets/tree/main/IDCBeehive)
Requires IDC Core. https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3341

Adds beehives that produce honey.  

Requires a honey bee to be placed inside the Bee slot in order to function. Honey bees have a limited lifespan. They can be found naturally inside new lootable tree stumps that spawn in the pine forest biome.

Adds writable storages with 120 slots. ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH DARKNESS FALLS. WILL NOT WORK WITH VANILLA.
